    <h1>Week 19– “Cleaning Out My Desk”</h1>


    <h2 id = "sec-preface">Preface</h2>

    <p>
I have a little trash can in my room. Every day, I toss in candy wrappers, water bottles, broken wires, and all sorts of trash. Once it’s full, I dump it into the trash room down the hall and forget it ever existed. I never really thought much of it. Trash is trash, after all. What could I do but throw it out? 

</p>
<p>
However, while bidding a tearful farewell to a a-bit-too-well-loved copy of a Percy Jackson novel, I came to a sobering realization. This book, that had been such an integral part of my childhood that it had split in half and had to be bound with rubber bands, would be discarded and forgotten like they never even existed. Not just this book, but all those little things that had shaped me into the person I am today would disappear with the closing of my trash can.

</p>
<p>
This project is a memorial to all these stepping stones, big and small, that have aided me through my life. By cataloguing my waste, I also catalogue myself as a whole. My weekly trash represents who I am and how I’ve changed: my needs, wants, habits, interests, goals, and struggles. Through it, I hope to gain a better understanding of myself as well as consider more carefully the things I choose to keep and throw away.

    <h2 id = "sec-overview">Overview</h2>

    <p>
        I cleaned out my desk this week. I like to keep my work and leisure spaces pretty separate, so I don’t often work on my desk. As a result, I usually end up treating my desk like an extra storage space… but not anymore! I have sorted out the drawers and put all the clutter on top into its proper positions. I predict that I have a week before it assumes its previous state. Either way, I found some interesting things in there, and by interesting things I mean “things that ought to have been thrown out years ago.”
    </p>

    <p> This week’s trash can be loosely grouped into three main categories— self-care and hygiene, education, and art. My medicine bag was shoved into one of my drawers, so I ended up throwing out a couple of things related to health, like an empty box of bandaids, and an expired bottle of hand sanitizer. Side note, this cleaning has reminded me that I really need to head to CVS and get some more medicine. I don’t even have Advil in there. I also tossed an empty box that once held a perfume I bought a few weeks ago. </p>


    <p>The second group is art-related. which consists of a plastic paint palette and a dried out expo marker. The paint palette is the cheapest, thinnest plastic I could find during Joann's closing sale. I have a giant stack of these, which is why I felt comfortable throwing this one out.  I’ve been feeling uninspired when it comes to painting lately, though. When I think of my best paintings, they were all done before I got these palettes. It’s kind of embarrassing, but I used to use the packaging of an empty Ferrero Roche box. It worked surprisingly well. The plastic was waterproof, so my watercolors didn’t soak into it, and the little cups let me mix all the colors I needed to. Maybe I need to go back to that. </p>

    <p>As for the marker, I keep my dry-erase markers in a little bucket that I’m pretty sure is supposed to be a flower pot. I decided to test them while I was cleaning, and found that the blue one no longer worked. I must have left the cap open or something. I guess I’ll be writing all my reminders in pink for the foreseeable future.</p>

    <p>	The final group is education. I’ve got an old barebones calculator that I have never used and I am fairly certain is older than me, a train ticket from when I came back to campus after the weekend, an old SAT book that my dad picked up at a garage sale years ago, and an old pair of Beats headphones. </p>

    <p>Of these, the headphones were the hardest to say goodbye to. My laptop has both Linux and Windows installed, and I use both operating systems for different things; for instance, I play games on Windows but do most of my schoolwork on Linux. However, there’s a strange glitch that happens whenever I try connecting my wireless earphones to it: it makes the other operating system no longer recognize the device. Every time I want to use my earphones on one operating system after using it on the other, I have to delete the earphones, restart the computer, and then restart the computer. This is a hassle, so I started using an old wired pair instead. However, I think it’s time to say goodbye. They’re peeling pretty bad, and the foam on the inside is visible.</p>

    <p>I made some tough decisions on what to toss and what to keep this week, but it resulted in a neater desk and some much-needed peace of mind. As always, thank you very much for reading! If there was anything you found particularly interesting, feel free to comment, and I will see you all next week for another Trash of the Week.</p>
